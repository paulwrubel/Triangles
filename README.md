Creates Triangles on a PApplet window supported by processing libraries.

    Triangles aim at mouse                                                        
    Triangles can move toward, away from, and orbit the mouse                     
    Trianges can shoot bullets.                                                   
    Color is based on mouse position (Background) and heading (Triangles/Bullets)
